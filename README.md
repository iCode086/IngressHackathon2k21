Student Bank Dapp for Ingress Hackathon 2021

An online application for scholarships to students pursuing higher studies built on Ethereum and transactions powered by Monero cryptocurrency.

In times of COVID-19, students find it difficult to negotiate and visit the fundraisers for the purpose of getting scholarships or funds for their further studies; this application enables the students to share their works, resume, etc. securely on blockchain which is immutable (to avoid plagiarism) for the fundraisers to judge and accept them to recieve the scholarship. Since Monero is used the money transaction is secured and both parties benefit is conquered without any loss.

The challenge for us during the project was to tackle the problem of linking the Monero GUI with the DApp running on localhost. Since for execution purpose we worked on the stagenet version of Monero GUI, the establishment of actual relation between the 2 mentioned was difficult not worked out in the end.


**It was lately committed because this is a new repository and since there are a lot of files but was completed at 5 p.m.
